Hey there! 
I am a PhD student in Information and Communication Technology for Health at <a href='https://www.unina.it/'>University of Naples 'Federico II'</a> (Naples, IT). The research topics of my PhD focus on developing, applying and improving Machine Learning methodologies, with a particular focus on Artificial Neural Networks.

In 2023, I have been a Visiting PhD Student at <a href='https://www.lbl.gov/'>Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory</a> (Berkeley, CA, USA) to work on applications of Machine Learning techniques on data gathered during the operation of the third-generation synchrotron light source <a href='https://als.lbl.gov/'>Advanced Light Source</a> (ALS) in collaboration with the ALS Accelerator Physics Group. I am currently a research affiliat at the same laboratory.

In 2024 I joined <a href='https://home.cern/'>CERN</a> (Geneva, CH) as a research affiliate at the <a href='https://home.cern/science/accelerators/clear'>CLEAR</a> facility, focusing on exploring the application of Machine Learning techniques to forecasting problems for particle accelerator research.

My background is purely based on Computer Science: I graduated in 2019 with a MS in Computer Science and in 2016 with a BS in Computer Science, both at the University of Naples 'Federico II'.
