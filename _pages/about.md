Hey there! 
I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at <a href='https://www.unina.it/'>University of Naples "Federico II"</a> (Naples, IT). My research focuses on developing, applying and improving Machine Learning methodologies, with a particular focus on Artificial Neural Networks.

My academic background is in Computer Science: I graduated in 2019 with a MS in Computer Science and in 2016 with a BS in Computer Science, both from the University of Naples "Federico II". In 2024, I completed my PhD in Information and Communication Technology for Health at the same institution focusing on Deep Learning methods.

In 2023, I was awarded a scholarship as a visiting PhD student at the <a href='https://www.lbl.gov/'>Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory</a> (Berkeley, CA, USA) to work on applications of Machine Learning techniques on data gathered during the operation of the third-generation synchrotron light source <a href='https://als.lbl.gov/'>Advanced Light Source</a> (ALS) in collaboration with the ALS Accelerator Physics Group. I am currently a research affiliate at the same laboratory.

In 2024, I joined <a href='https://home.cern/'>CERN</a> (Geneva, CH) as a research affiliate at the <a href='https://home.cern/science/accelerators/clear'>CLEAR</a> facility, focusing on exploring the application of Machine Learning techniques to forecasting problems for particle accelerator research. In the same year, as a visiting postdoctoral researcher, I was the Principal Investigator during an experimental week (10–16 November), funded by CERN through the European Union’s <i>"Horizon Europe - Research and Innovation"</i> programme. The focus of this week was to evaluate the CLEAR accelerator as an AI-driven testbed for CERN’s Efficient Particle Accelerator (EPA) project.

In 2024, I co-authored the paper <i>"PhysBERT: A Text Embedding Model for Physics Scientific Literature"</i>, which was accepted at the <a href='https://ml4physicalsciences.github.io/2024/'>Machine Learning and the Physical Sciences</a> workshop at the <a href='https://neurips.cc/'>NeurIPS 2024</a> conference. This work introduced PhysBERT, the first sentence embedding model specifically designed for the physics domain. Both the model and the dataset are available on <a href='https://huggingface.co/collections/thellert/physbert-66c21ee8e61ccd71d7d4414a'>HuggingFace</a>.
